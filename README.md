Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/circle-generator.git
cd circle-generator


Serve the application:Since this is a static web application, you can serve it using a local server. For example, using Python's HTTP server:
python -m http.server 8000

Alternatively, use any static file server or open index.html directly in a browser (note: some features may require a server due to CORS restrictions).

Dependencies:The project uses external CDNs for dependencies, so no additional installation is required:

Leaflet.js (v1.9.4) for map rendering
Tailwind CSS (v2.2.19) for styling
